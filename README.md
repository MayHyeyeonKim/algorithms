# LeetCode 300 Challenge – Review Phase (Feb 2026)

**Goal (2026):**  
Re-solve and deeply understand the 300 LeetCode problems completed in 2025.  
Focus on pattern recognition, time/space tradeoffs, and first-principles thinking.

**Status:**

- 2025 Completion: ✅ 300 / 300
- 2026 Review Mode: 🔄 In Progress

## 🎯 Review Strategy

- Solve problems **as if unseen**
- No peeking at old solutions unless stuck >30 minutes
- After solving:
  - Explain the core idea in plain words
  - Identify the algorithmic pattern
  - Note edge cases and complexity
